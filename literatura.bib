@article{Anselma06,
	Abstract = {Summary Objective In this paper, we define a principled approach to represent temporal constraints in clinical guidelines and to reason (i.e., perform inferences in the form of constraint propagation) on them. We consider different types of constraints, including composite and repeated actions, and propose different types of temporal functionalities (e.g., temporal consistency checking).},

@article{Fukunaga97,
	Abstract = {A number of successful applications of automated planning and scheduling applications to spacecraft operations have recently been reported in the literature. However, these applications have been one-of-a-kind applications that required a substantial amount of development effort. In this paper, we describe ASPEN (Automated Planning/Scheduling Environment), a modular, reconfigurable application framework which is capable of supporting a wide variety of planning and scheduling applications. We describe the architecture of ASPEN, as well as a number of current spacecraft control/operations applications in progress.},
