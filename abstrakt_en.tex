\begin{document}
The Simple Temporal Problem is one of the fundamental scheduling problems. In the context of formal verification, it is closely related to SMT, where we can encounter it while solving the theory of difference logic. In this work we create a solver for difference logic as a part of the OpenSMT solver. We look at existing approaches and evaluate their applicability to OpenSMT. Then we analyze an algorithm based on exhaustive theory propagation and use it to create an efficient implementation of the solver. This implementation is tested and compared to other current SMT solvers, proving its comparable efficiency.
